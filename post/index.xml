      <description>Having it all is a concept that society suggests everyone should strive to achieve. Your career should be rewarding. Your free time spent with your family. Promotions should be plentiful. Work-life balance a non-issue. Personally, I don’t think (most) men or women can have it all, and I don’t think they need to, either.
One of the key objectives on the quest to “have it all” is a fulfilling career. Depending on the person, a fulfilling career may include management or leadership roles, rapid advancement, and passion for one’s work.</description>

      <description>As a sophomore, when I was still studying Electrical Engineering, I went to the Career Fair with a list of ten companies in my pocket. My reasons for wanting to talk to these companies varied. Some were working on interesting projects, some were close to home, and a few were picked just because they said they had openings for Electrical Engineering internships. A week after I spoke with people at each of the companies and turned in applications online, a manager at Company X emailed me.</description>

      <title>The Computing Industy&#39;s Impact on Income Inequality</title>

      <description>Does the computing industry have an obligation to address social and political issues? Absolutely not. An industry has no obligations, as it is a term used to refer to a branch of companies with similar products. The companies that make up the computing industry likewise have no obligation other than to make their shareholders money. If MegaCorp or BigBusiness can make the most money by ignoring or even flying in the face of sociopolitical issues, I have little doubt that we would see policies in place that accomplish just that.</description>

      <title>Programming is not a Super-Power</title>

      <description>Karlie Kloss claims that coding is &amp;ldquo;a weapon, it&amp;rsquo;s like a super-power, it&amp;rsquo;s better than a super-power.&amp;rdquo; While I would agree that programming can be used as a weapon and that it can produce results more powerful than any super-power, I would not agree that programming in and of itself is a super-power. If something is a super-power, there must be something about that ability that is inherently limiting. For example, Superman has the ability to fly.</description>

      <description>Hi! My name is Matthew Fabian, and I am a senior studying Computer Engineering with a minor in Engineering Corporate Practice. I&amp;rsquo;m from sunny Buffalo, NY originally, and I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the past four years living in Alumni Hall. I came to Notre Dame with the intention of studying Electrical Engineering, but changed majors a few days into my junior year. As a fun side effect of that, I&amp;rsquo;ll be one of the first people to graduate following the new CSE curriculum.</description>
