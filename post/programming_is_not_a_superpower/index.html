            <p>Karlie Kloss claims that coding is &ldquo;a weapon, it&rsquo;s like a super-power, it&rsquo;s better than a super-power.&rdquo; While I would agree that programming can be used as a weapon and that it can produce results more powerful than any super-power, I would not agree that programming in and of itself is a super-power. If something is a super-power, there must be something about that ability that is inherently limiting. For example, Superman has the ability to fly. This is considered a super-power because not everybody has the ability to fly. Regardless of how hard I tried, I would be plummeting to the ground if I tried to jump out my window, not soaring through the air. But if I could, and so could everyone else, Superman might be considered a little bit less super.</p>

<p>There is nothing limiting about programming. Anybody can learn to code. Karlie is a fashion model, but learned how to code in order to better understand how technology works. And though programming may be super powerful, it isn&rsquo;t a super-power. As the world becomes more and more dependant on technology, people become more and more dependant on the technology&rsquo;s underlying code (and therefore, the programmers). Understanding that code isn&rsquo;t mysterious by nature and comprehending how it works may not only be useful, but necessary for a future world.</p>

<p>However, I do understand and appreciate the message behind claiming that programming is a super-power. Super-powers are cool and exciting, <em>beyond</em> human capabilities. When you code, you are able to create a program/project/system that accomplishes a task that would be impossible otherwise. Being able to &ldquo;unlock&rdquo; that capability by writing code and pressing buttons can seem magical. My younger cousin was amazed at the results of a short Python program she wrote that printed her name. Kindling this wonder and amazement at an early age may push more young people towards programming related careers (which seems to have been the goal of Karlie&rsquo;s video).</p>

<p>I would argue that coding is more powerful than a super-power. Because everyone has the ability to learn how to code, there is the additional benefit of collaboration. Superman worked alone, but developers are able to work in teams. Open source projects may have hundreds of contributors. Collectively, people can code together and produce technological innovations that bring about good in the world. The converse of that is true as well. Andy Ko wrote, &ldquo;&hellip;if code is a social contract, than cod<em>ers</em> are the ones being granted power by users.&rdquo; Coders must be careful with this power to prevent intentionally or unintentionally malicious code from being introduced into a system. It was Uncle Ben who said, &ldquo;With great power comes great responsibility.&rdquo; If coding is more than a super-power, we must be more than super-heroes to prevent those that may be worse than a super-villain.</p>

<p>The power of coding goes beyond the realm of super-heroes and villains. In the past few decades, tech companies have gained incredible influence over the world both culturally and economically. In 2016, the five largest corporations by market cap were <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-22/silicon-valley-reckons-with-its-political-power">briefly all tech companies</a>. As tech grows, its influence is expanding into previously undisturbed realms including politics. A not-too-distant future that could include self-driving cars and pervasive AI will only see the influence of technology increase. As a result it is important that people understand what drives technology. It&rsquo;s not magic and super-powers. It&rsquo;s not limited to a select group of individuals. It&rsquo;s code.</p>
