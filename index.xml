      <description>Karlie Kloss claims that coding is &amp;ldquo;a weapon, it&amp;rsquo;s like a super-power, it&amp;rsquo;s better than a super-power.&amp;rdquo; While I would agree that programming can be used as a weapon and that it can produce results more powerful than any super-power, I would not agree that programming in and of itself is a super-power. If something is a super-power, there must be something about that ability that is inherently limiting. For example, Superman has the ability to fly.</description>

      <description>Hi! My name is Matthew Fabian, and I am a senior studying Computer Engineering with a minor in Engineering Corporate Practice. I&amp;rsquo;m from sunny Buffalo, NY originally, and I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the past four years living in Alumni Hall. I came to Notre Dame with the intention of studying Electrical Engineering, but changed majors a few days into my junior year. As a fun side effect of that, I&amp;rsquo;ll be one of the first people to graduate following the new CSE curriculum.</description>
