      <description>Having it all is a concept that society suggests everyone should strive to achieve. Your career should be rewarding. Your free time spent with your family. Promotions should be plentiful. Work-life balance a non-issue. Personally, I don’t think (most) men or women can have it all, and I don’t think they need to, either.
One of the key objectives on the quest to “have it all” is a fulfilling career. Depending on the person, a fulfilling career may include management or leadership roles, rapid advancement, and passion for one’s work.</description>
