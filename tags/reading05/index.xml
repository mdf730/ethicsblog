      <description>Chelsea Manning’s story is filled with nuance. It isn’t easy to claim an informed opinion and at the same time declare her actions completely moral or completely immoral. When Chelsea Manning leaked classified information to WikiLeaks, she may have thought she was doing the right thing. Maybe she didn’t think that, and wanted attention or approval. I think that it’s important to remove speculative motive in order to understand the action and results of the action.</description>
