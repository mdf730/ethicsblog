      <description>My Kindergarten classroom had a poster displayed on the wall, outlining a Code of Conduct (of sorts) for the classroom. It read:
“Always keep your hands and feet to yourself.”
That was it. I’m sure there were rules about sharing and being kind and raising your hand to talk, but there was only one rule that was prominently displayed. When students broke that rule, it was easy for my teacher to point at the poster on the wall to provide reasoning on why the students shouldn’t have acted in the way they did.</description>
